## Project Overview
This project was completed as a colaboration between the Notre Dame Data Club and Cleveland Guardians. The goal of the project was to predict which factors influence fan engagement with both the Guardians, and individual players. As a part of this project, we explored regression, classification, and time series techniques to predict fan engagement, culminating in a presentation to the Guardians Business Analytics Team. This presentation with our in-depth findings can be found here: [ClevelandGuardiansFinalPresentation.pdf](https://github.com/jacklambert1/Cleveland-Guardians-Fan-Engagement/files/9420097/ClevelandGuardiansFinalPresentation.pdf)
